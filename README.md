# pricing-kaizen
Pricing engine which<br>
1. Listens to all the relevant signal changes (mrp, seller price, competitor price, etc) and persists them.<br>
2. Uses the signals to compute an optimal price for each listing.<br>
3. Applies subsidies to compute the fsp (flipkart_selling_price).<br>
4. Propagates those values realiably to multiple systems. (Fatak, discovery, etc)<br>
