Setup requires Kafka server & MySQL server running on your system.

MySQL setup
1. If you have a mac, then get the installation from a peer. Make sure you give a blank password for root while installing mysql
2. Run ./bootstrap.sh to create the bare DB
3. cd service/ && mvn liquibase:update (You would have to run liquibase:update each time a new migration is written)

Kafka Setup
1. The test suite requires a kafka server running on your system. You can use kafka_2.11-0.8.2.0. See instructions on website on how to start the server
2. Once the kafka server is up, create all the topics that you see in config/server_config/dev/pricing_kaizen.yaml under the heading kaizen -> kafka

To run the build, enter
mvn clean install

To run the server
cd service
mvn exec:java
